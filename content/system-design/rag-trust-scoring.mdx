title: RAG‑based Trust Scoring for Rentals
excerpt: Using embeddings + vector search to produce explainable trust scores across tenants/landlords.
---

### Problem
We need explainable trust scores from heterogeneous signals: payments, messages, documents.

### High‑Level Design
- Ingest events → normalize to Postgres
- Embed entities (docs/notes/events) → **pgvector**
- Retrieve (R) relevant context → LLM generate (G) score + rationale
- Persist score, factors, and **audit trail**

### Key Components
- API Gateway (NestJS)
- Scoring Worker (Node/Golang)
- Vector DB (pgvector/Pinecone)
- LLM Providers (OpenAI/Gemini)
- Queue (Redis/BullMQ)

### Trade‑offs
- Cost vs latency; caching retrieved chunks; nightly refresh
- Guardrails & Pydantic/Zod validation on outputs
